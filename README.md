Your tast is to attempt to take down this Stack by all means of the arsenal of functions given to you by the programm. 
There're 2 mistakes made on purpose:

1. Any changes in the stack data or structure responsible for stack count as a mistake
2. If you manage to call several mistakes at a time and didn't get a note about some of them, make sure that they all seperatelly give you the same feedback.
   If not, then it's the programm that couldn't show all mistakes due to the urgiency of the other one.
3. When problem is detected, programm will print you according message. (ERROR given value is NULL)
4. When it says "SUCCESSFULLY CLEARED" and you see that you've manage to change values - you won! Congrats!

Conditions:
1. Programm have to end with function MY_STACK_DTOR() or my_stack_dtor()
2. You can use function user_dump() for deteckting mistakes

That's it. Good luck!
